# TradeWise AI - Comprehensive Trading Platform

## Overview

TradeWise AI is a sophisticated stock analysis platform that provides AI-powered investment research, real-time market data, and comprehensive stock insights.

## Recent Changes (July 23, 2025) - SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY RESTORED

### Critical Bug Resolution - JavaScript toFixed Error
- **Root Cause Identified**: Template `displayResults()` function expected flat data structure but API returns nested `{success: true, analysis: {...}, stock_info: {...}}`
- **Data Structure Mismatch Fixed**: Updated template to properly extract data from `data.analysis` and `data.stock_info` objects
- **Safe Property Access**: Implemented comprehensive null checks and fallbacks for all `.toFixed()` calls to prevent undefined errors

### Technical Implementation Details
- Modified `displayResults()` function with safe access patterns: `typeof price === 'number' ? price.toFixed(2) : '0.00'`
- Added proper data extraction: `const stockData = data.analysis || data; const stockInfo = data.stock_info || data;`
- Implemented fallback values for all numeric properties to prevent runtime errors
- Added template script loading for `ai_stock_search.js` to enable enhanced search functionality
- Created dual-path search system with fallback to inline search if enhanced search unavailable
