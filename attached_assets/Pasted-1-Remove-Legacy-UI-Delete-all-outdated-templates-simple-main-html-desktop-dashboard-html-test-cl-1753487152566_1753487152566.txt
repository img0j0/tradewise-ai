1. Remove Legacy UI
Delete all outdated templates (simple_main.html, desktop_dashboard.html, test_clean.html, etc.) and redundant CSS/JS files (style.css, layout_fix.css, ai_stock_search_clean.js, etc.).

Keep only one design system: modern_saas_theme.css (will be rebuilt as part of this prompt).

Standardize all templates to extend from a unified base.html.

2. Apply New SaaS Design (Mockup Style)
Color Palette:

White/light gray background

Deep blue & purple accents

Premium accent color (gold/teal) for upgrade CTAs

Typography: Google Fonts (Inter/Manrope), clear hierarchy (18px base).

Buttons & Cards: Rounded corners, subtle shadows, hover effects.

3. NavBar (Top-Fixed)
Persistent NavBar in base.html:

Left: SignalStackDev logo + brand text.

Center: links → Dashboard, Search, Backtest, Peer Comparison.

Right:

Plan badge (Free/Pro/Enterprise).

Dark mode toggle.

User menu (Profile, Settings, Logout).

Upgrade button for Free users in premium accent color.

Search bar integrated into NavBar for global use.

4. Dashboard (3-Column Grid)
Redesign modern_dashboard.html:

Left Card: Portfolio Overview with sparkline chart (past 30 days performance).

Center Card: AI Insights – 3 clickable summaries with category icons.

Right Card: Market Highlights – top movers list and sector bar chart.

Cards must match the mockup: rounded, shadowed, clean typography.

Grid collapses to 2 columns on tablets, 1 column on mobile.

5. Search Experience
Build a unified search system (modern_search.js, enhanced_search.css):

Fuzzy matching (partial names, symbols, typo tolerance).

Autocomplete dropdown:

Show company logo, symbol, name, sector.

Keyboard & mouse selection supported.

Use Redis caching for <100ms results.

Search bar integrated directly in NavBar, consistent across all pages.

6. Premium Indicators & Upsell Flow
Lock icons + tooltips on all Pro/Enterprise-only features.

Upsell modal:

Triggered when Free users click locked features.

Preview feature benefits with images.

Upgrade Now button → Stripe checkout.

Plan badge in NavBar dynamically updates with user plan.

7. Dark Mode
Add a dark mode toggle (moon/sun icon) in NavBar:

All pages, cards, charts, and modals adapt to dark mode.

Save preference in localStorage.

8. Final QA & Optimization
Test all pages on desktop, tablet, and mobile:

Ensure desktop-first layout with max-width 1440px.

Sidebar/columns collapse gracefully.

Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox).

Minify CSS/JS for faster load times.

Validate caching & performance metrics.
