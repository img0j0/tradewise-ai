### AI-Powered Position Sizing
```python

    """Calculate position size based on AI confidence and risk tolerance"""
    max_position_percent = 0.05  # 5% max per position
    confidence_multiplier = confidence_score / 100
    
    base_amount = account_balance * max_position_percent
    adjusted_amount = base_amount * confidence_multiplier
    
    return min(adjusted_amount, account_balance * 0.1)  # 10% absolute max
```

### Stop-Loss Integration
```python
def place_order_with_risk_management(symbol, quantity, ai_confidence):
    """Place order with automatic stop-loss based on AI analysis"""
    current_price = get_current_price(symbol)
    stop_loss_percent = calculate_stop_loss(ai_confidence)
    stop_price = current_price * (1 - stop_loss_percent)
    
    # Place bracket order with stop-loss
    alpaca.submit_order(
        symbol=symbol,
        qty=quantity,
        side='buy',
        type='market',
        time_in_force='gtc',
        order_class='bracket',
